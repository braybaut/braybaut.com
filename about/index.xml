      <description>My name is Brayan Bautista and I am living in Bogot√° Colombia. I&amp;rsquo;m a System Engineering and am working as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer at Globant where I help customers to desing architectures to make scalables infrastructures and creating workflows to deploy in production environments with zero downtime.
I&amp;rsquo;m also Container and OpenSource Enthusiast, I really enjoy writing about anything that might help other engineers out with topics i can see in my daily basis, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in anything about containers, serverless and distributed systems, I really enjoy learning new languages and tools that can help in my career path, I also enjoy participate as a speaker at local meetups that promote the OpenSource.</description>
